Use Case Diagrams
What are Use Case Diagrams?
A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between system actors (users or external systems)
and the system itself. It captures the functional requirements of a system by illustrating the various ways users can
interact with it, helping to define system scope and behavior in a clear, understandable format.

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
Visual Clarity: Provides an easily understandable overview of system functionality

Stakeholder Communication: Bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders

Requirement Validation: Helps identify missing or incomplete requirements early

Scope Definition: Clearly outlines system boundaries and interactions

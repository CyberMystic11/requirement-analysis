Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The process of Requirement Analysis is broken down into five key activities that transform
vague ideas into a clear, actionable plan:

Requirement Gathering
This is the initial stage of collecting all possible needs and constraints from various stakeholders 
(clients, users, experts) through techniques like interviews and surveys.

Requirement Elicitation
A more proactive process of drawing out latent, unexpressed, or unclear requirements that stakeholders
may not explicitly state. Techniques include workshops and user observation to uncover the true core problems.

Requirement Documentation
The formal recording of agreed-upon requirements in a structured document. This creates a single source of truth,
such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) or user stories, which guides the entire development team.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling
The critical examination of requirements to identify inconsistencies, gaps, and priorities. 
Modeling uses visual aids like diagrams (e.g., UML, flowcharts) and prototypes to simplify
complexity and validate the logical system design.

Requirement Validation
The final step of formally checking and confirming that the documented requirements are accurate, complete,
and aligned with stakeholder needs. This is done through reviews and sign-offs to prevent costly changes later in the development cycle.

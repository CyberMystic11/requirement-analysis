 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Thorough requirement analysis is critical for project success. Its key importance includes:

1.  Prevents Costly Errors: Fixing a misunderstanding during the analysis phase is far cheaper than after development has begun.

2.  Aligns Stakeholder Vision: Ensures developers, clients, and users all share a common understanding of what will be built, 
    reducing the risk of building the wrong product.

3.  Provides a Development Roadmap: Clear requirements serve as a blueprint for designers, developers, and testers,
    enabling accurate planning and estimation

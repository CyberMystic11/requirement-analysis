Acceptance Criteria
Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
Acceptance Criteria are conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, 
or other stakeholders. They play a crucial role in requirement analysis by:

Providing Clarity: Defining clear, testable conditions that eliminate ambiguity about when a requirement is complete

Aligning Expectations: Ensuring developers, testers, and stakeholders share a common understanding of what constitutes a successfully implemented feature

Guiding Development: Serving as a checklist for developers during implementation

Facilitating Testing: Providing the basis for creating test cases and validating functionality

Reducing Rework: Preventing misunderstandings that lead to costly changes later in the development process

Well-defined acceptance criteria help transform vague requirements into specific, verifiable conditions that ensure the delivered functionality meets business needs and user expectations.

Example: Acceptance Criteria for Checkout Feature
Feature: Checkout Process for Property Booking

Scenario: Successful booking with valid payment method

Acceptance Criteria:

Payment Processing

Given a user has selected a property and dates

When they proceed to checkout with a valid payment method

Then the system should process the payment successfully

And display a confirmation message with booking details

Booking Confirmation

Given a payment has been successfully processed

When the transaction is complete

Then the system should create a booking record in the database

And send a confirmation email to the user

And notify the property host of the new booking

Error Handling

Given a user attempts to checkout with an invalid payment method

When they submit the payment

Then the system should display a clear error message

And not create a booking record

And not charge the user's payment method

Price Calculation

Given a user has selected dates for their stay

When they view the checkout page

Then the system should display a breakdown of costs including:

Base nightly rate

Security Requirements

Given a user is on the checkout page

When they enter payment information

Types of Requirements
In software development, requirements are typically categorized into two main types: Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements. 
Understanding both is crucial for comprehensive requirement analysis.

Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should do - the specific behaviors and functions it must perform.

Examples for a Booking Management System (AirBnB Clone):

Users shall be able to search for available properties by location, date range, and number of guests

The system shall allow registered users to create and publish property listings

Users shall be able to book available properties for specific dates

The system shall process payments through integrated payment gateways

Hosts shall be able to manage (approve/deny) booking requests for their properties

Users shall be able to write and read reviews for properties after completed stays

Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform - the quality attributes and constraints under which it must operate.

Examples for a Booking Management System (AirBnB Clone):

The system shall load search results within 2 seconds for 95% of queries (Performance)

The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during peak booking seasons (Reliability)

All user data and payment information shall be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (Security)

The interface shall be usable by people with visual impairments (Accessibility)

The system shall support simultaneous usage by 10,000 users (Scalability)

The application shall have a consistent visual design across web and mobile platforms (Usability)

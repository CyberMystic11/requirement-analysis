What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders collaboratively identify, document, 
and validate the needs and constraints that a software system must satisfy. 
This process translates vague or abstract ideas into clear, actionable specifications that guide design, development, and testing.
